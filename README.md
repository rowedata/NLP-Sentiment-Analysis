# Sentiment Analysis Model

Sentiment analysis is a common NLP task that involves determining whether a piece of text expresses a positive, negative, or neutral sentiment.

# NLP Sentiment Analysis in Python
We'll build a sentiment analysis pipeline using Python, and the workflow will include the following steps:

1. Data Collection: We'll use a publicly available dataset.
2. Data Preprocessing: Cleaning and preparing the text data.
3. Vectorization: Converting text into numerical features.
4. Model Training: Training a machine learning model.
5. Model Evaluation: Evaluating the performance of the model.
6. Prediction: Using the model to predict sentiment on new text.
